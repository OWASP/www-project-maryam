# Contribution

Contributes are welcome! Here is a start guide: [Development Guide](https://github.com/saeeddhqan/maryam/wiki/Development-Guide)
You can add a new search engine to the util classes or use the current search engines to write a new module.
The best help to write a new module is checking the current modules.

# Roadmap

 - Improving Iris page ranking
 - Write a complete metacrawler engine based on OSINT by using the current search engines
 - Add clustering algorithms: Done
 - Web user interface
